# Hank Sway - P2 - xkcd Password Generator

## Live URL
<http://p2.hankswaydwa15.me>

## Description
This is a password generator inspired by the xkcd comic. It offers the users the ability to choose the number of words in their password, and whether or not they would like to use uppercase first letters, a symbol, and/or a number.

## Demo
<http://screencast.com/t/Ffh4hEWH>
Note: in my demo, I mention that I was unsure why I had to use the preg_replace() function rather than str_replace() in my logic.php file. This was subsequently resolved in this thread: <https://piazza.com/class/hykay018bam4zp?cid=219>

## Details for teaching team
I don't think there's anything special you need to know!
